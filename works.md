# Software Development for Sonification App
I am working in the [IPSOS](http://ipsos.web.cern.ch/) project, a web based platform for online data sonification of high energy physics that was created for educational outreach and workshops. It is a collaboration between the University of Birmingham, CERN, ITU/MIAM and the Birmingham Ensemble for Electroacoustic Research. Supporting website of IPSOS can be seen [here](http://ipsos.web.cern.ch/IPSOS_support_website/support.html).
