_This page tells you a little bit about me._

Konstantinos Vasilakos is a performer and composer of Electroacoustic music. Based in Istanbul, he is leading the Sonic Arts department of the Center for Advanced Studies in Music of the Istanbul Technical University (ITÃœ). He is interested in performance with real time music systems using gestural controllers, sonification, and live coding. His current research interest focuses in the use of raw data from the Large Hadron Collider, from CERN, in Switzerland. Projects include Dark Matter, a live coding project using data from the LHC, and most recently the IPSOS, an interactive Physics Sonification system for educational outreach in collaboration with the art@CMS, at CERN. He holds a PhD in Music from Keele University in the UK, and a Masters degree from the Utrecht School of the Arts, in the Netherlands. His works have been presented in France, The Netherlands, Germany, Czech Republic, Greece, Switzerland, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. He has collaborated with leading research centers such as CERN, in Switzerland, and the Laboratoire ACROE/ICA, at the University of Grenoble, in France.

# Chunk's Bio
Chunk Norris was educated in the realm of the oligarchy of pitch and rhythm of understandable music, albeit soon enough he found himself abiding with the rules of ungraspable and complex orders ingrained in electronic circuits, silicon boards and interactive interfaces operated by hardware paraphernalia. He creates post electro-acoustic music using hitherto available computer music systems within the milieu of digital arts Nowadays, he enjoys hacking code in front of the audience by altering temporality of musical algorithms while at run, aka live coding.
