_This page tells you a little bit about me._

Konstantinos Vasilakos is creating Electroacoustic music and he is an interdisciplinary artist working in the millieu of digital arts and interactive media. Based in Istanbul, he is leading the Sonic Arts department of the Center for Advanced Studies in Music [MIAM](https://www.miam.itu.edu.tr), in Istanbul Technical University (ITÃœ). His [courses](https://konvas.github.io/teaching/) elaborate in the creation of interactive music and composition of algorithmic composition. His research interests involve sonification, new instruments for musical expression and live coding with networked computer based environments. His projects include Dark Matter, a live coding project using data from the LHC, and he is the author of [IPSOS](http://ipsos.web.cern.ch/IPSOS_support_website/support.html), a web-based interactive Physics Sonification application for educational outreach in collaboration with the art@CMS, at CERN. He has also authored numerous [software](https://konvas.github.io/software/) for the creation of interactive projects involving real time sonification of bodily movement and dance as well as interactive sound installations. He holds a PhD in Music from Keele University in the UK, and a Masters degree from the Utrecht School of the Arts, in the Netherlands. His works have been presented in France, The Netherlands, Germany, Czech Republic, Greece, Switzerland, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. He has collaborated with leading research centers such as CERN, in Switzerland, and the Laboratoire ACROE/ICA, at the University of Grenoble, in France.

# Chunk's Bio
Chunk No_reace was educated in the realm of the oligarchy of pitch and rhythm of understandable music, albeit soon enough he found himself abiding with the rules of ungraspable and complex orders ingrained in electronic circuits, silicon boards and interactive interfaces operated by hardware paraphernalia. He creates post electro-acoustic music using hitherto available computer music systems within the milieu of digital arts Nowadays, he enjoys hacking code in front of the audience by altering temporality of musical algorithms while at run, aka live coding.
