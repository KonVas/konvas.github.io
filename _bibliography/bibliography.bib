	volume = {17},
	abstract = {This paper reports on the outcomes of a project using a Leap Motion1 (LM) to interact with a custom-made performance environment named Greap -, Gr(ain) + (l)eap. The project was set to explore live improvisation within the genre of computer music with a particular interest in the audible transparency of the gestural manipulation of sonic material in real time. It comprises of an interactive platform, developed in the SuperCollider2 (SC) programming environment controlled by the LM sensor. Greap3 was created with a particular focus on enabling gestural metaphors that enhance the expressivity of a computer music performance. The mimesis of recognizable gestural actions, coupled with corresponding sonic material, can achieve transparency4 enabling performers and the public to establish causal relationships between the former and the latter. Mapping (the connections between control signals and synthesis parameters of a performance system) and its variation throughout the performance are given particular emphasis via changeable blocks of control parameters. The performer is able to design the blocks before a performance, precomposing the mapping according to the interaction (s)he wants to achieve and change it dynamically allowing the performer to explore the diverse interaction capabilities offered by the environment. To demonstrate the system, an analysis of a semi-improvised live performance that was created with the environment is presented.},
